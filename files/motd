Welcome to the Puppet master!
  This is where you will do all of your testing.

To run ALL modules on this host simply run:
  puppet agent -t --debug

You can test modules indvidually with:
  puppet apply --debug -e "include my-module-name-here"

Your modules are in:
  /opt/modules/

Your modules have been automatically added to:
  /etc/puppet/environments/production/manifests/site.pp

Except for '/opt/modules/*' any changes made
  to this container are lost when you 'exit'.

The ./modules directory has been mapped to /opt/modules,
  any changes you make to it via this container are
  applied to the real files on the host. Be careful!
