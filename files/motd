Welcome to the Puppet master!
  This is where you will do all of your testing.

To run ALL modules on this host simply run:
  puppet agent -t --debug

You can test modules indvidually with:
  puppet apply --debug -e "include my-module-name-here"

Any yaml files you put in ./hiera are available in:
  /var/lib/hiera/

Your modules are in:
  /opt/modules/

Except for the directories below any changes made
  to this container are lost when you 'exit'.

The ./modules and ./hiera directories have been mapped
  to /opt/modules and /var/lib/hiera; any changes you 
  make to them in this container are applied to the 
  real files on the host. Be careful!
