Welcome to the Puppet master!
  This is where you will do all of your testing.

To run ALL modules on this host simply run:
  puppet agent -t --debug

You can test modules indvidually with:
  puppet apply --debug -e "include my-module-name-here"

Hiera data can be added to:
    /var/lib/hiera/common.yaml

The ./modules and ./hiera directories have been mapped
  to /opt/modules and /var/lib/hiera; any changes you 
  make to them in this container are applied to the 
  real files on the host. Be careful!
